# Rust and WebAssembly-based Intelligent Agent

This project implements an intelligent agent using Rust and WebAssembly (Wasm). The agent is designed to observe its environment, think and make decisions, act based on those decisions, and remember past experiences. The project is modularized into several components, each responsible for a specific functionality.

## Features

- **Observation**: Processes input data to understand the environment.
- **Thinking**: Uses strategies to make decisions based on observations.
- **Action**: Executes actions based on decisions.
- **Memory**: Stores past observations and decisions for future reference.
- **WebAssembly**: Compiles Rust code to WebAssembly for web-based applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
